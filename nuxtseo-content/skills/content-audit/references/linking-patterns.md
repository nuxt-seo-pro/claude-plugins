# Linking Patterns by Content Type

## Educational Content → Reference Docs

When articles mention features, link to their documentation:

| Content Type | Link Pattern |
|--------------|--------------|
| Feature mention | `/docs/[feature]/getting-started` |
| API reference | `/docs/api/[endpoint]` |
| Configuration | `/docs/config/[setting]` |
| Component | `/docs/components/[name]` |

## Reference Docs → Educational Content

When docs explain concepts, link to learning resources:

| Concept Type | Link Pattern |
|--------------|--------------|
| How-to guide | `/learn/[topic]/[guide]` |
| Best practices | `/learn/[topic]/best-practices` |
| Troubleshooting | `/learn/[topic]/common-issues` |

## Content Hub Linking

Hub/index pages should link to:
- All child pages in that section
- Related features in other sections
- Getting started guides for beginners
- Advanced guides for experienced users

## Cross-Feature Linking

Identify features commonly used together:

1. **Complementary features** — If feature A often requires feature B, link between them
2. **Alternative approaches** — If multiple features solve similar problems, cross-reference
3. **Prerequisites** — Link to required setup or dependencies
