# Conversion Audit Patterns

Persona-based testing for sales/landing pages.

See `../../.shared/persuasion.md` for psychology shifts and objection categories.

## Personas

| Persona | Experience | Key Concern |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Junior Dev** | 1 year, startup | "Is this worth it at my skill level?" |
| **Mid-level Dev** | 3 years, production apps | "Could I build this myself?" |
| **Senior Dev** | 7+ years, enterprise | "Is this technically sound?" |
| **Tech Lead** | Budget holder, team manager | "How do I justify this to stakeholders?" |
| **Indie Dev** | Bootstrapped, solo founder | "Is this worth it pre-revenue?" |

## Workflow

1. **Read page** - identify claims, features, pricing, CTAs, social proof
2. **Test each persona** - ask "Why would they NOT buy?"
3. **Find universal objections** - patterns across 3+ personas
4. **Recommend fixes** - what to add/change, specific copy, placement
