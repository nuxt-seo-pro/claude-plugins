# Common Objection Patterns

Patterns from testing developer product sales pages.

## Pricing Objections

### "Hidden Costs"
**Pattern:** Base price shown prominently, per-seat/per-project costs buried.
**Fix:** Interactive pricing calculator. Show real totals upfront.

### "Paying for Vaporware"
**Pattern:** Roadmap features mixed with available features.
**Fix:** Clear "Available Now" vs "Coming Soon" badges. Lead with what ships today.

### "Per-Seat Doesn't Fit"
**Pattern:** Team pricing when users have 1 project.
**Fix:** Show per-project breakdown. "For 1 project, your cost is $X"

## Trust Objections

### "Solo Maintainer Risk"
**Pattern:** One-person operation without contingency plan.
**Fix:** Source code access, extended refund policy, delivery deadlines with guarantees.

### "History of Delays"
**Pattern:** Product previously missed timelines.
**Fix:** Acknowledge honestly. Add accountability: "If X doesn't ship by Y, full refund."

### "No Proof"
**Pattern:** Vague claims without data.
**Fix:** Specific metrics: "2-5% traffic lost" not "improve your traffic."

## Value Objections

### "I Could Build This"
**Pattern:** Features seem simple enough to DIY.
**Fix:** Time framing: "Building this = 2-3 weeks. At $100/hr, that's $X opportunity cost."

### "Free Alternatives Exist"
**Pattern:** Open source tools cover similar ground.
**Fix:** Differentiate on integration, time savings, support. "Yes, you could use [X], if you have time to [list of work]."

### "Not Ready to Use"
**Pattern:** Waiting for specific feature.
**Fix:** Clear roadmap with dates. "If you need X immediately, wait until [date] or use [alternative]."

## Fit Objections

### "Is This For Me?"
**Pattern:** Unclear target audience.
**Fix:** "Perfect If You..." and "Wait If You..." sections.

### "Too Expensive for My Stage"
**Pattern:** Pricing assumes certain scale.
**Fix:** Explicit stage guidance: "Best for sites with >1,000 monthly visitors."

### "Enterprise Needs"
**Pattern:** Individual pricing doesn't scale.
**Fix:** "Contact for team/enterprise pricing" with clear threshold.
