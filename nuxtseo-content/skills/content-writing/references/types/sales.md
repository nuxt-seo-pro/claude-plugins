## Pricing Presentation

### Tier Structure

```markdown
### Free
For individual developers
- All cursor rules
- Core MCP servers

### Pro - $19/mo
For teams shipping fast
- Everything in Free
- Premium MCP servers
- Priority support
```

### Pricing Psychology

| Pattern | When |
|---------|------|
| Anchor high | Show enterprise first if selling mid-tier |
| Annual discount | "2 months free" beats "17% off" |
| Price per unit | "$0.50/user" feels smaller than "$50/team" |

**Avoid:** Hidden costs, "Contact us" for basic pricing, too many tiers (3 is ideal)

### Social Proof

```

## FAQ Section
