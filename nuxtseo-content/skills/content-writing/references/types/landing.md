# Landing Page Patterns

Conversion-focused copy for developer tools.

## Core Principles

1. **Lead with Outcome, Not Feature**
   - Feature: "Built-in SSR support"
   - Outcome: "Ship SEO-friendly pages without configuration"

2. **Be Specific**
   - Vague: "Blazing fast performance"
   - Specific: "3x faster builds than Create React App"

3. **Speak Developer**
   - Marketing: "Leverage our cutting-edge solution"
   - Developer: "Less boilerplate. More shipping."

4. **Show, Then Tell** - Code speaks louder than copy

## Page Sections

### Hero

```markdown
# {site.tagline}

{site.name} helps [audience] [outcome] without [pain point].

[Get Started] [View Demo]

Trusted by 500+ customers
```

### Problem

Agitate the pain before offering the solution:

```markdown
## Scheduling shouldn't take 15 back-and-forth emails

Phone tag wastes your time. Custom booking pages cost $5,000+.

**There's a better way.**
```

### Features

List what it does, framed as benefits:

```markdown
### Smart Scheduling
Syncs with your calendar, handles timezone conversion automatically.
```

### How It Works

3 steps max. Reduce friction by showing simplicity.

### Social Proof

Specific testimonials with metrics, not "Great product!"

## Headlines

| Category | Pattern | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Benefit | [Outcome] for [Audience] | "Effortless scheduling for busy professionals" |
| Contrast | Stop [X]. Start [Y]. | "Stop chasing. Start booking." |
| Specificity | [Number] [Noun] in [Time] | "Set up in 5 minutes" |

**Headline tests:**
- Could a competitor use this exact headline? (too generic)
- Does it answer "why should I care?" in 3 seconds?

**Avoid:** "AI-Powered", questions as headlines, unverifiable superlatives

## CTAs

See `../../../.shared/persuasion.md` for CTA patterns.

**Be specific:** "Get Started - Free", "Start Your Free Trial"

## SEO

| Element | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| Title | `[Product]: [Value Prop]` |
| Meta | 150-160 chars: what it is, who it's for, key benefit |
