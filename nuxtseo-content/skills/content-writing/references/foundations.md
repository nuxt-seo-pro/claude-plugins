# Writing Foundations

## Voice

Developer-to-developer. Casual but accurate. Use "we" for shared experience, "you" for instructions. Vary sentence length.

**No hedging:** "Do X" not "You may want to consider X"
**Be specific:** "Google rewrites 70%" not "Search engines may modify"

## Stats

Always WebSearch to verify stats. Search `[topic] statistics [current-year]`. Cite with source + year: `"67.6% have duplicate content (Semrush, 2024)"`

Sources: Semrush, Ahrefs, W3Techs, HTTPArchive, Google

## Banned

**Words:** dive into, crucial, essential, vital, robust, seamless, leverage, utilize, ensure, comprehensive, harness, empower, elevate, unlock, game-changer, delve, realm, landscape, plethora, myriad

**Phrases:** "it's important to note", "in today's [X]", "let's explore", "this is where X comes in", "at its core", "when it comes to", "by the end of this guide"

**Patterns:** Rhetorical questions, three-adjective chains, filler intros, superlatives without proof, em dashes (use hyphen only)

**Endings:** Never "Now you're ready to...", "Happy coding!", "In conclusion..." - just stop or link to next action.

## Quick Fixes

| Slop | Fix |
|------|-----|
| It's important to note that... | [just state it] |
| This allows you to... | You can... |
| In order to... | To... |
| provides a way to | lets you |
| is designed to | does |

## Persuasion

**PAS** (features, landing): Problem → Agitate → Solve
**AIDA** (landing, emails): Attention → Interest → Desire → Action
**4 U's** (headlines): Useful, Urgent, Unique, Ultra-specific

## Code

- TypeScript only (not JavaScript)
- Replace `{site.url}`, `{site.name}` with values from site-config.md
- Run `date +%Y-%m-%d` for dates, update `updatedAt` frontmatter

## Gap Markers

Mark unknowns: `[STAT NEEDED: X]`, `[VERIFY: X]`, `[LINK: X]`
Then immediately WebSearch to fill them.
