# Persuasion Patterns

Shared patterns for sales pages and conversion audits.

## Psychology Shifts

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| "LIMITED TIME!" | "3 modules ready now" |
| "Maximize SEO" | "2-5% traffic lost to X" |
| "Don't miss out!" | "If you want to wait..." |
| Hidden risks | Transparent guarantees |
| Universal appeal | Target qualification |

## Common Developer Objections

| Objection | Address With |
|-----------|--------------|
| "Could build this myself" | Time calculation: "Building this = 2-3 weeks" |
| "What if abandoned?" | Commitment: "Active development since 2020" |
| "Solo maintainer risk" | Bus factor mitigation, open source core |
| "Hidden costs?" | All-inclusive pricing, no surprises |
| "Is this for me?" | Explicit "Who Is This For" section |

## Objection Categories

### Value/Price Mismatch
- "Paying for vaporware" (features marked "coming soon")
- "Could build this myself"

**Fixes:** Lead with what's available NOW, time-saved framing

### Trust Issues
- "Solo maintainer = bus factor of 1"
- "No testimonials with metrics"

**Fixes:** Extended refund policy, specific testimonials ("Reduced X by Y%")

### Proof Gaps
- "Demos look fake"
- "Vague claims without data"

**Fixes:** Label demos honestly, add problem metrics

### Unclear Fit
- "Is this for me?"
- "Too expensive for my situation"

**Fixes:** "Who Is This For?" section, "Wait If You..." to disqualify

## Qualification Sections

### Who Is This For

```markdown
**Perfect fit:**
- Teams with 5+ developers
- Shipping production apps weekly

**Wait if you:**
- Solo dev on side projects (free tier works)
- Need feature X (coming Q2)
```
