## Problem

```markdown
## Generic AI Wastes Your Time

Coding assistants don't understand framework conventions.

- They suggest React patterns in Vue files
- They ignore Nuxt's auto-imports
- They miss component library APIs
- You spend more time fixing than building

**Your AI should know your stack.**
```

## Solution

```markdown
## Framework-Native AI Tooling

AI Frontend gives Claude and Cursor deep knowledge of your framework.

### Cursor Rules
Pre-configured rules for Vue, Nuxt, React, and Next.js.
Stop correcting your AI.

### MCP Servers
Connect to Nuxt UI, Pinia, TanStack Query, and 20+ libraries.
Claude sees your actual component APIs.

### Claude Skills
Drop-in skills for component generation, refactoring, and testing.
One command, not ten prompts.
```

## How It Works

```markdown
## Set Up in 60 Seconds

**1. Choose your framework**

​```bash
npx aifrontend init
? Select framework: › Nuxt
? Select libraries: › Nuxt UI, Pinia, VueUse
​```

**2. Add to your editor**

​```bash
npx aifrontend install cursor
# or
npx aifrontend install claude-code
​```

**3. Start building**

Your AI now understands your stack.
```

## Comparison

```markdown
## Before & After

### Without AI Frontend

​```
You: Create a Nuxt UI button component
AI: Here's a React button with className...
You: No, I said Nuxt UI
AI: Sorry, here's a Vue component with class...
You: Use the UButton component
AI: I don't have access to that API...
​```

### With AI Frontend

​```
You: Create a Nuxt UI button component
AI: ​```vue
<UButton
  color="primary"
  variant="solid"
  @click="handleClick"
>
  Click me
</UButton>
​```
​```

**One setup. Zero corrections.**
