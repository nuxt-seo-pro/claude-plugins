"Here are two options for a structured data hook:

**Option 1 (Problem-focused):**
Most Nuxt developers ignore structured data until they notice their search results look bare compared to competitors' rich snippets—by then they've already lost clicks to better SEO performance.

**Option 2 (Opportunity-focused):**
Structured data transforms your Nuxt site from invisible text in search results into rich, interactive snippets that Google actually understands—and it takes just minutes to implement with the right approach.

Which direction resonates more with your audience?"
